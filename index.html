    <!-- In order to build our nav bar, use lists. <ul> is basically the container of the list and <li> is a single element in the list.

			  To insert a link in the nav bar, simply put an anchor tag <a> inside a <li>. 

			  For the link's href, we use id's which is another CSS selector (ID uses "#" as opposed to a class's ".". This makes sure that clicking on a link will automatically sroll down to a specific section.

			  Finally, notice how our HTML is divided used <section> instead of <div>.-->
